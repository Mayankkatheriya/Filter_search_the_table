## Explanation:

`HTML (index.html)`:

* The HTML file sets up a webpage for searching within a table.
* It includes meta tags for character set and viewport settings.
* The title is set to "Searching in the Table."
* External CSS styles are linked from "./styles.css."
* The page includes a heading with the creator's name and a heart emoji.
* An input field for searching by name is provided.
* A table is present with headers "Customer Name" and "Country."
* The table body ("tbody") initially contains sample data that's commented out.

`CSS (styles.css)`:

* The CSS file defines various styles for the webpage.
* It sets a radial gradient background and styles headings, input field, and the table.
* Media queries adjust font sizes for smaller screens.

`JavaScript (script.js)`:

* The JavaScript code initializes variables to work with the table and sample data.
* Sample data is loaded into the table rows upon page load.
* A function filterTable is created to filter table rows based on search input.
* An event listener listens for input changes in the search field and updates the table accordingly.

`Summary`:

This code creates a webpage for searching within a table. Users can enter search queries into the input field to filter the table rows based on the name column. The page's creator is mentioned in the header. The background design is visually appealing. The JavaScript code handles dynamic filtering and updating of the table based on user input, using a samp4le dataset.
